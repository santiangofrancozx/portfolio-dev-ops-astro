        Hi, I’m Santiago Franco, though many know me as Safrax. My programming journey started with a simple curiosity—unraveling how computers work. That curiosity led me to write my first code in Scheme, igniting a passion that has since evolved into a career of solving complex problems through technology.

        As a back-end developer and DevOps engineer, I thrive on creating efficient, innovative solutions while collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. Beyond coding, I’ve embraced my love for teaching by serving as a teaching assistant, empowering others to grow while constantly learning from those around me.

    <p>
        For me, every line of code is an opportunity to create something meaningful, and every challenge is a chance to grow.
